## What is Swiftech?

Swiftech is a remote technical support company centered around a single need: to help people make the best use of their technology. It was initially founded under the name DropByte in July 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. At that time, I saw a large shift of workers moving home to do their jobs, and I realized that it would be even more important to keep our computers working together correctly.

The company remained idle for months. With little marketing other than word-of-mouth, I relied solely on the idea that I had built something that I would find customers. After a while of that _not_ working, I deployed a few instagram ads - again, with little success.

Time flew by, and I continued to develop my service. I implemented what became known as QuickBytes - simple guides to help people work through issues with their technology. Further, I added scheduling to the website and _finally_ figured out a way to get paid, using HoneyBook as my CRM and payment solution. And, I made sure to use Zoom to connect with my clients to provide some level of personal touch while I was helping them work through technical issues.

Now that I had fully fleshed out the business end, it was time to really push for clients. Surprisingly, I found that most of my work quickly became focused on web development, so I added that to my business’s areas of focus. To this day, my primary source of income with Swiftech has remained through web development.

Yet, I didn’t want to abandon my initial tech support dream. I doubled down on what it would take to provide reliable tech support from anywhere, and worked out a deal with a friend where he could handle physical device repairs, and I would handle the software side. 

## So, Where Do We Go From Here?

Swiftech is still in its infancy. My hope is to grow the client base and provide people an affordable way to get tech help, wherever they are. Yet, as I grow my own offering of services and focus on other projects, it will become more important to find new talent and grow the business internally and externally. Eventually, the hope is to split the web development work from the technical support work, so that Swiftech continues to offer high-quality assistance and web development can be its own thing.

That being said - if you are talented with computers and maintenance, or if you need technical assistance, be sure to reach out using the contact form (or schedule some time with me) over at our website, [Swifte.ch!](Https://Swifte.ch "Swiftech") We’re looking forward to working with you.
