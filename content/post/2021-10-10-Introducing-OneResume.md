## What is OneResume?

Managing your resume can be hard, and navigating the endless amounts of services that pin you against your competition is arguably harder. OneResume is a service that brings your resume to your own space on the web, so that the focus can be on you and your experiences. So, how does it work?

## How It Works

The first step is to send us your resume. We won’t write it for you - we’re not HR professionals. But if you need a reference to get a good one started, we have a network of affiliate resume writers in our back pocket.

After we receive your resume, we’ll have a quick chat over Zoom to discuss what templates, colors, and other personal touches you’d like to make. If we offer extra information on OneResume sites that isn’t covered in your resume, we’ll ask about those things too! Finally, we’ll ask for some sort of username that you’d like to use. For instance, my personal resume is hosted at [richdmartin.oneresume.us](Https://richdmartin.oneresume.us "richdmartin.oneresume.us"). 

Within 24 hours, you’ll see your resume on our site in its full glory, using the template and colors that you’ve chosen. And paying for it is easy - there are no upfront costs; just a subscription that you can cancel any time. 

Need to update your resume? Our premium package gives you access to a content management system that you can access any time to keep things up-to-date. Otherwise, we’ll update it once every month for free. If you need more edits, we can do that easily for a small fee. 

## What does the future look like?

We’re glad you asked! With your subscription, you’ll instantly get access to all new features available in your tier. And don’t worry - we’ll make sure to let you know when they arrive.
