Welcome to my personal blog! Here, you'll find information on projects I'm working on, my travels and more. I'm a self-proclaimed Digital Nomad, a Web Developer, and an Aspiring Entrepreneur. I hold a Bachelor's in International Business, and my goal is to use that knowledge along with my technical expertise to bring the world closer together.

I am currently traveling Europe, having first arrived here on August 29, 2021. I think travel is an extremely important vessel to expose ourselves to different mindsets, cultures, and more. You can find out more about my travels here on this blog as well!

Be sure to check out some of the things I've been working on! I currently have two main services I offer: the first is Swiftech, a technical support company which also engages in web development. We do computer work remotely over Zoom, and use a variety of technologies to create beautiful websites. A more recent project is OneResume, a website that aims to put your resume on the web in an eye-catching format. Think of it as something akin to Linktree and LinkedIn, but it holds a special emphasis on you. You can find out more information on each respective company with special articles I've written here, on my website.

Get in touch with me with any questions you might have, or if you'd like to work together on a new project!
